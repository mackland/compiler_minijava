## compiler_minijava

***

I have finally decided to create my own compiler. This is something I have wanted to do since I first learned how to code, and would question what had originally been coded to create the program I was typing my code into.

I will be following the advice and steps given in __Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools__ by _Aho et. al_ for a subset of Java. I have looked at other sources like __Modern Compiler Implementation in Java__ by _Appel_ but feel the former gives a more thorough explanation of all relevant concepts.
