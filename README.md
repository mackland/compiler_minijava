## compiler_minijava

***

I have finally decided to create my own compiler. This is something I have wanted to do since I first learned how to code, I would question what kind of program could 'understand' the program I was writing. This is my attempt to finally answer this question.

I will be following the advice and steps given in __Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools__ by _Aho et. al_ for a subset of Java.
