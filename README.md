## compiler_minijava

***

Finally decided to create my own compiler, something I have wanted to do since I first learned how to code. I will attempt to start out by keeping the lexer and parser handwritten.

I will be following the advice given in __Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools__ by _Aho et. al_.
