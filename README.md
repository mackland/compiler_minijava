## compiler_minijava

***

Finally decided to create my own compiler, something I have wanted to do since I first learned how to code. Want to keep lexer and parser handwritten.

I will be following the advice and steps given in __Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools__ by _Aho et. al_ for a subset of Java.
